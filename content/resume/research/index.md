title: Research
summary: I discovered research during university and got hooked because it let me apply what I was learning in a meaningful way. A family history of cancer and unpredictable diseases sparked my curiosity, driving me to explore data science in medicine.

## Sydney Data Precision Centre (SPDSC)
### Junior Researcher
#### August - October 2024

The [Sydney Precision Data Science Centre (SPDSC)](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/our-research/research-centres/sydney-precision-data-science-centre.html) at the University of Sydney is a multidisciplinary research hub dedicated to addressing critical societal challenges through precision data analysis. During a <ins>three-month mentorship</ins> program with SPDSC, I worked with a team under the supervision of a [Dr Pratibha Panwar](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/pratibha-panwar.html#collapseprofileresearchinterest), focusing on characterising cell types in healthy and disease-state tissue using **single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data**. I pitched the idea of exploring cancer as our research focus, which was embraced by the team.

Our project aimed to uncover gene expression differences between healthy and diseased tissues. Leveraging publicly available datasets, including the study *“Single-cell analyses define a continuum of cell state and composition changes in the malignant transformation of polyps to colorectal cancer”*, we employed the `Seurat` R package for **clustering**, **visualisation**, and **differential gene expression** analysis. `R` and RStudio served as our primary tools, enabling us to identify and characterise cell types and gain insights into the biological processes driving disease progression.

This work culminated in a **presentation night**, where we showcased our findings to mentors, fellow mentees, judges, and SPDSC heads. The experience provided a deep understanding of data-driven approaches in biomedicine and underscored the significance of interdisciplinary collaboration in solving complex challenges.

## Biokind Analytics
### Data Analyst
#### October - December 2023

[Biokind Analytics](https://www.biokind.org/) is a non-profit organisation that leverages data science to enhance the impact of healthcare-focused non-profits. By providing data analytics and statistical modeling services, Biokind assists these organisations in optimising operations, improving efficiency, and making data-driven decisions. 

{{< figArray subfolder="biokind" figCaption="Meeting with the ALS Association" >}}

As part of my research with Biokind Analytics, I collaborated on a project analysing patient data provided by the [ALS Association](https://www.als.org/support/states/texas), focusing on the state of Texas. Due to the nature of ALS — <ins>a disease that is difficult to characterise, predict, and cure</ins>, our goal was to develop a profile of **socioeconomic** and **geographic** factors *influencing* ALS care in Texas.

Using `R`, we employed statistical methods, including `t-tests` and `regression analysis`, to examine variables such as `income`, `age`, and `geographical location`. We analysed veteran and *non*-veteran populations, clinic usage, and travel distances to treatment centers. Key findings included significant differences in age distributions between veterans and non-veterans, as well as regional patterns highlighting disparities in access to care.

This research provided valuable insights, contributing to **targeted recommendations** for improving resource allocation and patient support.
