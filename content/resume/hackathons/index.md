I thrive on building innovative solutions in high-pressure, collaborative environments — and hackathons are my favorite playground. Here’s a glimpse into some of the most rewarding projects I’ve been a part of.

## **Build Club x Eucalyptus AI Hackathon, December 2024**
### 🚀 *Love, Blandy: Support When It’s Needed Most*

Inspired by Euc’s roadmap and a critical 16-hour gap in patient support, our team developed Love, Blandy, a Python-powered web app leveraging Bland.ai’s API. This solution bridges the communication gap between coaches and patients by initiating daily AI check-ins, collecting patient progress data, and displaying insights on a coach dashboard.
