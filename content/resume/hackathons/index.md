## **Atlassian x UNIHACK**
### 🚀 *Call Sous*

We’ve all been there—staring at a fridge full of ingredients but unsure what to cook. Sous was born from the frustration of decision fatigue in the kitchen. We wanted a smart, seamless way to recognise ingredients, suggest recipes tailored to personal health goals, and provide real-time cooking assistance. Sous is your AI-powered sous chef. Scan your ingredients, get personalised recipes, and call Sous for real-time cooking help—whether it’s substitutions or seasoning fixes. Cooking made effortless.
