## Intern @ Boehringer Ingelheim | [Reccomendation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tWiaOu22PpZb2OWk4lOO49HIjfIU2qDY/view?usp=sharing)
#### *Dubai, UAE*, October - December 2023
My internship program at [Boehringer Ingelheim](https://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/) was uniquely structured to give me exposure to multiple verticals within IT, including **data science**, **software engineering**, **technical project management**, and **infrastructure** — all within the span of just three months. This dynamic setup allowed me to work with diverse teams simultaneously, tackling a variety of challenges and gaining a holistic understanding of how IT drives innovation in a global organisation.

### Technical Project Management Intern
Played a key role in planning the annual flagship [*Technology and Innovation Expo*](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/oliver-sluke_technology-innovation-expo-2023-in-dubai-activity-7123613190361407488-Yw8X?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), a purely internal event, as one of four core team members, coordinating a **500+ attendee event**. Took charge of **communications**, **vendors**, and **logistics**, ensuring the event’s seamless execution. Designed and distributed multimedia promotional content to *60,000+* internal stakeholders, significantly boosting event visibility. <ins>Conducted 30+ “1-Minute Interviews”</ins> with key stakeholders, including the global CIO. The highlight for me was serving as the event’s <ins>Master of Ceremonies</ins>, engaging with 500+ attendees and setting the energy for the rest of the event.

### Data Science Intern
I led and carried out a network analysis project for the System Changer Network (SCN) Kenya, a [Make More Health (MMH)](https://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/sites/default/files/mea/2023-04/V2%20Kopie%202.pdf) initiative connecting **nine NGOs across Kenya** to address diverse community needs, from clean water to mental well-being. Designed and developed a **Power BI dashboard** by integrating data from eight disparate sources, streamlining data collection processes, and incorporating iterative feedback to deliver actionable insights. This work enhanced the SCN’s ability to address underserved community challenges holistically.

### Infrastructure Intern
<ins>Rebranded</ins> the company’s internal vodcast, *Socialized*, by creating a *new* identity, **digital assets**, and **marketing strategies** to boost engagement. I also **Hosted** and **co-hosted several episodes**, and served as <ins>assistant producer</ins>, helping reshape the vodcast’s relevance for employees. My favourite part was being able to tie in my own extensive videography experience and passion in a corporate environment.

## Biokind Analytics
### Data Analyst
#### October - December 2023

[Biokind Analytics](https://www.biokind.org/) is a non-profit organisation that leverages data science to enhance the impact of healthcare-focused non-profits. By providing data analytics and statistical modeling services, Biokind assists these organisations in optimising operations, improving efficiency, and making data-driven decisions. 

{{< figArray subfolder="biokind" figCaption="Meeting with the ALS Association" >}}

As part of my research with Biokind Analytics, I collaborated on a project analysing patient data provided by the [ALS Association](https://www.als.org/support/states/texas), focusing on the state of Texas. Due to the nature of ALS — a disease that is difficult to characterise, predict, and cure, our goal was to develop a profile of **socioeconomic** and **geographic** factors *influencing* ALS care in Texas.

Using `R`, we employed statistical methods, including `t-tests` and `regression analysis`, to examine variables such as `income`, `age`, and `geographical location`. We analysed veteran and *non*-veteran populations, clinic usage, and travel distances to treatment centers. Key findings included significant differences in age distributions between veterans and non-veterans, as well as regional patterns highlighting disparities in access to care.

This research provided valuable insights, contributing to **targeted recommendations** for improving resource allocation and patient support.
