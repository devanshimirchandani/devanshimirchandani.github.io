## **Software Engineering Intern @ Plumm**
#### *Remote*, June - July 2024
At [Plumm](https://www.heyplumm.com/), I worked directly with the CTO to advance `Emma AI`, their in-house chat and voice AI therapist central to the HR platform. My role involved **rigorous testing** and **documentation** to ensure quality and reliability. Additionally, I explored ways to expand Emma's capabilities, including researching the integration video functionality through third-party services like [Soul Machines](https://www.soulmachines.com/), moving beyond traditional chat and voice interactions to create a more immersive experience.

## Intern @ Boehringer Ingelheim
#### *Dubai, UAE*, October - December 2023
My internship program at [Boehringer Ingelheim](https://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/) was uniquely structured to give me exposure to multiple verticals within IT, including **data science**, **software engineering**, **technical project management**, and **infrastructure** — all within the span of just three months. This dynamic setup allowed me to work with diverse teams simultaneously, tackling a variety of challenges and gaining a holistic understanding of how IT drives innovation in a global organisation.

Played a key role in planning the annual flagship [*Technology and Innovation Expo*](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/oliver-sluke_technology-innovation-expo-2023-in-dubai-activity-7123613190361407488-Yw8X?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), a purely internal event, as one of four core team members, coordinating a **500+ attendee event**.

### Data Science Intern
I led and carried out a network analysis project for the System Changer Network (SCN) Kenya, a [Make More Health (MMH)](https://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/sites/default/files/mea/2023-04/V2%20Kopie%202.pdf) initiative connecting **nine NGOs across Kenya** to address diverse community needs, from clean water to mental well-being. Designed and developed a **Power BI dashboard** by integrating data from eight disparate sources, streamlining data collection processes, and incorporating iterative feedback to deliver actionable insights. This work enhanced the SCN’s ability to address underserved community challenges holistically.

### Infrastructure Intern
<ins>Rebranded</ins> the company’s internal vodcast, *Socialized*, by creating a *new* identity, **digital assets**, and **marketing strategies** to boost engagement. I also **Hosted** and **co-hosted several episodes**, and served as <ins>assistant producer</ins>, helping reshape the vodcast’s relevance for employees.
