## Girls Programming Network (GPN)
### Academic Volunteer

As a volunteer with the [Girls Programming Network](https://www.girlsprogramming.network/), I led beginner-level **workshops** for **K-12 students**, teaching the basics of `Python`, including `if` statements, `for` loops, and simple programming concepts.

It was *incredibly* rewarding to be on the other side of the classroom, guiding students through their first coding experiences. Teaching reminded me of my own journey, from writing my first `Hello, World!` program to building a passion for programming. Watching students *light up* as they solved their first coding challenges was a highlight of this experience.
