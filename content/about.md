Hello:wave: I'm a **penultimate-year student** at the University of Sydney, pursuing a Bachelor of Advanced Computing (Honours) with double majors in *Computational Data Science* and *Finance*. 

Born and raised in Dubai, I now call Sydney home. Apart from `all-things-tech`, I love gaming, meeting new people, videography, and stepping out of my comfort zone. I’m crazy about leadership and community engagement; <ins>I've been part of seven university societies</ins> (founded two), and hosted a technology and innovation expo with **500+ attendees** — to name a few of my experiences.

My approach to proramming is guided by **"Build. Break. Learn."** to thrive on developing solutions, push boundaries, and learn from each experience, whether it’s a success or failure. Through my work, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a range of meaningful projects, from teaching high school students programming in Python to participating in **cancer research** using single-celled RNA sequencing data. *Very* cool experience.
