Hello:wave: I'm a **penultimate-year student** at the University of Sydney, pursuing a Bachelor of Advanced Computing (Honours) with double majors in *Computational Data Science* and *Finance*. 

Born and raised in Dubai, I now call Sydney home. Beyond my passion for technology, I enjoy gaming, meeting new people, exploring videography, and challenging myself to step *out* of my comfort zone. I'm deeply interested in leadership and community engagement, which has led me to participate in <ins>over seven university societies</ins>, including founding one of them. One of my proudest moments was helping organise a technology and innovation expo that brought together over **500 attendees**.

My approach to programming is guided by **"Build. Break. Learn."** to thrive on developing solutions, push boundaries, and learn from each experience, whether it’s a success or failure. Through my work, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a range of meaningful projects, from teaching high school students programming in Python to participating in **cancer research** using single-celled RNA sequencing data. *Very* cool experience.
