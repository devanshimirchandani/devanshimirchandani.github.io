Hello:wave: I'm a penultimate-year student at the University of Sydney, pursuing a Bachelor of Advanced Computing with double majors in Computational Data Science and Finance. 

Born and raised in Dubai, I now call Sydney home. Apart from coding, I love theatre, making films, video editing, and stepping out of my comfort zone.

My approach to technology is guided by _I build, I break, I learn_ I thrive on developing solutions, pushing boundaries, and learning from each experience, whether it’s a success or failure. Through my work, I’ve had the opportunity to 
contribute to meaningful projects, from social impact initiatives in Kenya to hosting a tech expo with 500+ attendees. 

I’ve honed my technical skills in software engineering, data science, and project management, and I’m always looking for new ways to apply these skills for a greater impact.

Beyond my technical work, I’m crazy about leadership and community engagement. I founded the Biokind Analytics chapter at the University of Sydney, and currently serve as the Founding Head of Curation for TEDxUSYD. I also volunteer as an academic tutor for the Girls Programming Network, where I mentor high school students interested in tech.
